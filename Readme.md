### Supporting Materials

The File "SupportingMaterials" contains the Matlab codes of the APDOB optimized by our proposed method "Fuzzy_APDOB100.mat" and the comparison methods "Comparison_APDOB100.mat".

You can use them to recurrent the simulation results shown in our submission paper.

We hope these supporting materials can help you to valuation our work better!

As for the searching process code, it involves internal tool chains and not ready going to public now. 

We will rewrite these parts for publication after acceptance.

 

#### Fuzzy_APDOB100.mat

You can run Fuzzy_APDOB100.mat to obtain the simulation results of the proposed method provided in our paper.

The information of the fuzzy controller auto-designed by the DE algorithm can be found in "Data/FuzzyControllerOptimizedByDE.fis".



#### Comparison_APDOB100.mat

You can run it to obtain the simulation results of the comparison methods.# Fuzzy-APDOVB
